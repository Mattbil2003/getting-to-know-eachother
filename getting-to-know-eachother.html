    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hi! my name is Matthew Bilinski. You can call me Matt. I'm 18 years old and currently attending Lewis as a freshman. I'm from Lockport, IL. Before I came to Lewis, I went to Providence Catholic high school. And before that, I went to Saint Dennis grade school. For hobbies, I like playing the eletric and acoustic guitar. I also like playing video games and hanging out with my friends. My family consists of 5 people. There's Myself, my twin brother and twin sister, my mom, and my dad. We also have a dog, a lizard, and a bunch of fish. My siblings are sophmores in highschool.

<h2>My Favorite Hobby</h2>
<p>
My favorite hobby is playing the guitar. I picked it up during the first few months of Covid as a way to pass time. I have a blue, 6 string PRS 24 standard electric guitar. I also have an acoustic electric guitar, of which I don't even know the brand. I also have a Boss Katana 25 amp. I like playing rock, metal, and pop song covers. I learn everything I play off youtube and tab documents. One funny thing about me and guitar is how I can play the guitar, but I can't read music. Since I'm self taught, I just use tabs and play songs by ear.
